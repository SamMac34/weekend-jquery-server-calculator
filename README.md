# Weekend Server-side Calculator


## Description

A simple calculator to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.


Q: What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

A: It was challenging to get the calculation to happen in the server POST request between recieving the data and sending it back to the client and also keeping track of the variable values during the process. To solve this, I used lots of console logs to track the variable values and followed along with the the code to know how to order the processes within the server POST request.
